My name is Simon Raymond. I have finished my Third year at Saint Mary's University in Halifax NS. I currently have not picked a major but i am very interested in Econometrics and Machine learning.

I intend to keep learning Machine Learning techniques outside of a classroom. This is where i will be uploading some of my generic or basic Algorithms and Practices.
