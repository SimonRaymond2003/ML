For all my codes i will try to follow similar patterns. 

I use bootstrapping in all of my codes instead of k-fold-cv. While it creates more work as many functions have k-fold-cv built-in i feel it is worth it as it is a more robust way of getting validation samples and allows me to make as many as i want.

For the initial train/val/test process the train/val will be bootrapped a number of times to ensure im getting a relatively representative display of what each hyperparameter actually is. Then i will test the best average hyperparameter (based on some metric) on a set aside test set. This entire process will repeat N times. 

Then i take the top 50% of the test scores and run the hyperparameters n times on the entire data. i have my code set in a way that they are each tested/validated on the same samples. i then take the mean of these scores and use them to select my best model.

Then i do a final run of the winning model to present a graph of the metric used and its INDIVIDUAL CI.


* i want it noted i acknowledge the weakness in the fact that the set aside test set is very random and may not be incredibly reliable due to the fact that we can't K-F-CV or B/s it since it must remain seperate. An idea i have had to combat this is to mabye split the test set into K pieces (similar to K-F-CV) but keep the model data (train and val sets/data) the same. i then could test each of the splintered test sets and take the mean of the test results for each selected hyperparameter set. Im not sure if this will have a different effect but i will look into it and test it.
